            Greetings, this is the private domain of my coding collection. Built with the upmost [lazy] care.
            Since you've stepped into my domain, I guess it wouldn't hurt for you to look around [please leave as soon as you can] . 
            Now that you're here, I'll tell you a bit about myself...
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Levi Duarte, I'm a adapt coder working on many projects in HTML, CSS, and JS [JavaScript]. 
            I like a lot of things such as Sports, Movies, VideoGames, Cartoons, Manga and Anime.

                    This project was a little challenging, the basic concept is supposed to be a 50/50 chance randomizer
                    to choose between 2 doors. One would be the right door, and the other door would be wrong. A little,
                    mini-game I made after days of researching and leaning JavaScript Logic, this is one of my most 
                    proud projects.

                    Learning more into logic and thinking rationallly with computers and applying JavaScript was probably
                    one of my most greatest obstacles to overcome. This project wasn't easy, after taking time to understand,
                    review code, and learn more about JavaScript logic was I able to finish a Mock Calculator. I say "Mock" because
                    this Calculator can calculate anything but negative numbers and decimals. However, in the future will I come back to
                    this and improve my coding skills.

                    After learning more into JavaScript Logic, I've come to a realization. I'm still struggling, but after 
                    careful examination and reserach, I've created the Password Game. Creating inputs for your password and
                    you the user try to guess the password after reading the given hint.

                    Being inspired by the iconic game "Pong", I've used JavaScript physics to build a Pong style soccer game.
                    I worked a long time to create this and after assistance in this field, I built the project, but my only 
                    regret is its gameplay. It still has bugs and glitches that need to be worked out, but overall, it was a success.
