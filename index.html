            Greetings, this is the private domain of my coding collection. Built with the upmost [lazy] care.
            Since you've stepped into my domain, I guess it wouldn't hurt for you to look around [please leave as soon as you can] . 
            Now that you're here, I'll tell you a bit about myself...
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Levi Duarte, I'm a adapt coder working on many projects in HTML, CSS, and JS [JavaScript]. 
            I like a lot of things such as Sports, Movies, VideoGames, Cartoons, Manga and Anime.

                        This project was a little challenging, the basic concept is supposed to be a 50/50 chance randomizer
                        to choose between 2 doors. One would be the right door, and the other door would be wrong. A little,
                        mini-game I made after days of researching and leaning JavaScript Logic, this is one of my most 
                        proud projects.

                        Learning more into logic and thinking rationallly with computers and applying JavaScript was probably
                        one of my most greatest obstacles to overcome. This project wasn't easy, after taking time to understand,
                        review code, and learn more about JavaScript logic was I able to finish a Mock Calculator. I say "Mock" because
                        this Calculator can calculate anything but negative numbers and decimals. However, in the future will I come back to
                        this and improve my coding skills.

                        After learning more into JavaScript Logic, I've come to a realization. I'm still struggling, but after 
                        careful examination and reserach, I've created the Password Game. Creating inputs for your password and
                        you the user try to guess the password after reading the given hint.

                        Being inspired by the iconic game "Pong", I've used JavaScript physics to build a Pong style soccer game.
                        I worked a long time to create this and after assistance in this field, I built the project, but my only 
                        regret is its gameplay. It still has bugs and glitches that need to be worked out, but overall, it was a success.

                        Going into more deeper understanding of JS I've learned that 3rd Parties have developed another interface
                        of JS called Phaser. In short it's a language that piggybacks off another language, in our case JavaScript.
                        This 3rd Party [Phaser] is essentially a game developement language. In use of this language, I've built a 
                        demo platformer, but I wanted to expand and make something more fun
                    </p>

                        SIDE NOTE: The game won't work if you begin the game with the spacebar, click the game space FIRST to 
                        function properly

                My name is Levi Duarte, I'm an adept programmer currently learning web design at West-Mec here at Glendale, Arizona. 
                I plan to learn other programming languages such as Python, but I still need to finish my 
                courses in web design. Our languages include HTML, CSS and JS (JavaScript).
                I've learned a lot of things other than web design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have many hobbies around and outside the computer world. You can already tell that I'm an 
                anime fan, I watch Bleach, Fire Force, Cowboy Bepop, DragonBall, One Punch Man, and My Hero Academia.
                I love Arizona sports such as basketball, football and baseball. I'm into videogames such as Star Wars Jedi, Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact, Injustice, Star Wars Battlefront,
                DragonBall FighterZ, Spider-Man, Arkham Series, and even Super Smash Bros. In my free time I would find recreation in these things,
                but I also write code and build small projects. I want to test myself and see if I can rely on my own experience. I've built a Phaser Game, Mouse Cursor Trail and even custom images styling.
                I try to update my portfolio whenever I can to show more experience I possess.
